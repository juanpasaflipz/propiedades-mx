# Real Estate Aggregator MX - Consolidation Progress

## What We've Done So Far

### âœ… Phase 1: Monorepo Foundation
1. **Created Turborepo structure** - Modern monorepo with optimized builds
2. **Set up shared configs**:
   - ESLint for code quality
   - Prettier for formatting
   - TypeScript configs for different app types
3. **Established project structure**:
   ```
   apps/
   â”œâ”€â”€ api/      # Express backend
   â”œâ”€â”€ web/      # Next.js frontend
   â””â”€â”€ scraper/  # Scraping service
   packages/     # Shared code
   services/     # Additional services
   ```

### ðŸ”„ Phase 2: API Migration (In Progress)
- Copied Rentek backend (most stable and secure)
- Updated for monorepo structure
- Created environment configuration template

## What's Next

### Immediate Tasks:
1. **Install dependencies and test the API**
   ```bash
   cd real-estate-aggregator-mx
   npm install
   cd apps/api
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Set up the database**
   - Create PostgreSQL database
   - Run migrations from apps/api/src/db/migrations

3. **Migrate the frontend**
   - Copy from Rentek
   - Integrate best UI components from other repos

### Key Improvements Made:
- **Better organization** - Clear separation of concerns
- **Shared configurations** - Consistent code style across all apps
- **Type safety** - Shared TypeScript configs and future shared types
- **Modern tooling** - Turborepo for fast builds and caching

### Learning Points:
1. **Monorepos** help share code and ensure consistency
2. **Turborepo** optimizes builds by caching and running tasks in parallel
3. **Shared configs** reduce duplication and maintenance
4. **Proper structure** from the start saves time later
